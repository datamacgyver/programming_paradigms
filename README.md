# programming_paradigms
This is just a few notebooks I wrote for an internal learning session. Members of the Data Science team were
interested in the differences between functional and object orientated programming so I put some examples 
together. 

The standard "I'm not really sure I know what I'm doing" warnings apply. 

These lessons are best consumed in the following order:
* Procedural
* Functional 
* Object Orientated
